          <p class="text-paragraph">Hello, my name is Davor Angelov, i was born on November 9, 2004, in Gostivar,
            Macedonia.<br>
            Currently, I am a dedicated student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering. My journey into the
            field
            of computer science was quite challenging, as I had no prior knowledge in the area. However, through
            determination
            and hard work, I successfully navigated the demanding coursework and projects, developing a solid foundation
            in
            programming and software engineering.<br>
            I am passionate about technology. My main goal is to succeed as a programmer and software engineer. I aspire
            to
            contribute to society through innovative software solutions and aim to give back to my family for their
            unwavering
            support.<br>
            Although I don't see any of my achievements as major milestones, I'm proud of my perseverance and
            adaptability
            in
            overcoming the early challenges of my education.

            solutions and contribute to the tech industry. The journey ahead is challenging, but my passion for
            technology and my dedication to learning keep me motivated. I can't wait to see where this path takes me and
            what I can achieve as a software engineer.

            <p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a creative side. I have a keen interest in acting and have
              participated
              in numerous theater performances as a member of the theater group in Gostivar. This experience has not
              only
              made my acting skills better, but has also enriched my life with the joy of storytelling and performance.
              Other than that, I also like to play basketball whenever I can, and I have practiced basketball at a
              smaller
              age. </p>
